🔥 Secure File Drop – Mastery Roadmap
🧱 Phase 1: Project Foundation
Goal: Set up a clean, maintainable full-stack environment and version control.

 Initialize GitHub repo (clean commit history, README with roadmap).

 Set up monorepo or split front-end/back-end repos.

 Backend scaffold: Express/Fastify, dotenv, basic route.

 Frontend scaffold: Vite + React + Tailwind.

 ESLint, Prettier, Husky (git hooks), editorconfig.

 .env.local setup, .gitignore ready.

🔐 Phase 2: Auth System
Goal: Secure user login, registration, and JWT-based session.

 Create users table/model (SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB).

 Register endpoint → hash password (bcrypt).

 Login endpoint → verify + issue JWT (httpOnly cookie).

 Auth middleware (JWT validate).

 Frontend: Auth forms with validation, redirect logic.

📤 Phase 3: File Upload + Storage
Goal: Upload to local/cloud, store metadata in DB.

 Multer/S3 setup for secure uploads.

 DB schema: file metadata (owner, name, MIME, expiry, view count).

 Upload endpoint → store + log.

 Frontend: Dropzone, preview, upload progress.

🔗 Phase 4: Secure Sharing Links
Goal: Time-limited, tamper-proof links.

 Create HMAC signer with secret key.

 Endpoint: /download/:fileId?sig=...&expires=...

 Validate link on server → deny if tampered/expired.

 Link generator on frontend → copy/share feature.

🧼 Phase 5: Expiry + Auto-Delete
Goal: Clean expired files & protect storage.

 CRON job / background task: delete expired.

 Add “delete after X downloads” option.

📈 Phase 6: Access Logs + Dashboard
Goal: Track usage, show insights.

 DB logs access by user/file/timestamp/IP.

 Dashboard route + API for analytics.

 Frontend dashboard page.

🚀 Phase 7: Polishing + Deployment
Goal: Ship with confidence.

 Deploy backend (Railway, Render, etc.)

 Deploy frontend (Vercel, Netlify).

 Link custom domain, HTTPS, environment variables.

 README with screenshots, demo video, tech stack, resume bullet points.
